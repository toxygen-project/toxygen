# Pull requests

Developer? Feel free to open pull request. Our dev team is small so we glad to get help.
Don't know what to do? Improve UI, fix [issues](https://github.com/toxygen-project/toxygen/issues) or implement features from our TODO list.
You can find our TODO's in code, issues list and [here](/README.md). Also you can implement [plugins](/docs/plugins.md) for Toxygen.

Note that we have a lot of branches for different purposes. Master branch is for stable versions (releases) only, so I recommend to open PR's to develop branch. Development of next Toxygen version usually goes there. Other branches used for implementing different tasks such as file transfers improvements or audio calls implementation etc.
